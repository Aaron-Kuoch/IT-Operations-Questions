## In business or technical terms describe your understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)?

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where a team implements new code into the code base. When the change is made, an automated test is run to identify bugs and errors in the new code. If the test does not identify any problems with the new code, the the developer can continue to make changes. However, if there is an issue, it is the duty of the developer to fix the new code before continuing with any new code. The use of CI is essential in software projects, especially if you are working in a team. This is because it minimises the number of errors when merging one person's code with another, and thus, maximises the speed of completing the code. Moreover, most, if not all features in an application will run successfully without having to wait for problems to occur when the application is live. 

### What are some tools that are used for this and why are they used.
