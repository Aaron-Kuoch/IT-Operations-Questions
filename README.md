## In business or technical terms describe your understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)?

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where a team implements new code into the code base. When the change is made, an automated test is run to identify bugs and errors in the new code. If the test does not identify any problems with the new code, the the developer can proceed to make other changes if needed. However, if there is an issue, it is the duty of the developer to fix the new code before continuing. The use of CI is essential in software projects, especially if you are working in a team. This is because it minimises the number of conflicts when merging one person's code with another, and thus, maximises the speed of completing the application. Moreover, most, if not all features in an application will run successfully without having to wait for problems to occur when the application is live. 

Continuous delivery (CD) is a practice that comes after continuous integration. Once the new code has successfully been implemented into the code base, the code is automated into different environments for testing and/or production. This is a major advantage for developers as they do not have to waste time deploying the software into any environment as this is done automatically. This allows them to test for any bugs faster and thus devlier more frequent updates to their application which generally results in higher customer satisfaction. When these tests are successful and ready to be deployed, it must be manually done by a user. For the deployment to be done automatically, a tool that uses contiuous deployment must be used. There is no difference between continuous delivery and deployment other than the fact that delivery deploys the software manually and deployment deploys the software automatically.

## What are some tools that are used for this and why are they used.

A tool that is used for CI/CD is Jenkins.
